      <description>&amp;#x1f44b; there!
I am Saurav, an engineer who loves building products with user empathy. I am a DIY person who&amp;rsquo;s a big fan of tinkering / hacking around stuff. In real life, I like anything that flies - RC planes, drones, gliders, ornithopters. ðŸ›¸
As a child, I used to spend a lot of time playing J2ME games and was amazed to see the revolution of mobile devices since 2004.</description>
