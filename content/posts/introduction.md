:wave: there!

I am Saurav, an engineer who loves building products with user empathy. I am a DIY person who's a big fan of tinkering / hacking around stuff. In real life, I like anything that flies - RC planes, drones, gliders, [ornithopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithopter). ðŸ›¸

As a child, I used to spend a lot of time playing [J2ME games](https://phoneky.com/games/) and was amazed to see the revolution of mobile devices since 2004.

At the age of 14, I rooted an Android device. It gave me a superpower to explore various files outside of [`/home`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/file-hierarchy.7.html) and what's outside of it that makes up a firware image of Android. The next thing I remember is I was drenched down in the XDA blogs figuring out a way to install [custom ROMs](https://www.xda-developers.com/history-of-lineageos/) and trying to replace boot animation with a batman logo. :bat: :superhero_man:

> Life had something else planned for me.

In a completely unrelated way, I landed up in [Asia's first space university](https://www.isro.gov.in/iist.html) with a major in Flight Electronics. In college, my curiousity took me to places like aerodynamics, semiconductors, machine learning, and Arch Linux. :surfer:

> Life happened, again

Totally unplanned, I joined as a founding engineer of two early stage VC backed startups to build out the products in the consumer space where the scope of problem statements is infinite.

The pandemic of 2020 led me to realize that life is too short to do only one thing for the rest of my life. So, I just decided to do what excites! :rocket:
